  <h1>Simple Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>Ingrediants</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk or water (optional, for creaminess)</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
      </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Whisk the eggs:</b> In a small bowl, crack the eggs and add the milk (or water) and<br>salt. Vigorously whisk the mixture until the yolks and whites are uniformly combined<br>with no streaks.</li>
        <li><b>Heat the pan:</b>Melt the butter (or brush the pan with oil) in a nonstick skillet over<br>medium heat.</li>
        <li><b>Cook:</b>Pour the egg mixture into the hot skillet. Let it sit for a few seconds without<br>stirring.</li>
        <li><b>Scramble:</b>Use a rubber spatula to gently pull the cooked edges toward the center,<br>forming large curds. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, folding and stirring<br>every few seconds, allowing the uncooked egg to flow underneath.</li>
        <li><b>Finish:</b>Remove the pan from the heat when the eggs are mostly set but still glisten<br>with moisture. They will continue to cook slightly from the residual heat. Season with<br>pepper and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
